### Project

The goal was to generate an image that matched your statement, so my statement was about privacy on the internet.

The statement reads:
`People are too ignorant about privacy on the internet.` 
We deal with it every day, and yet we have no idea what privacy on the internet actually entails.

#### Final prompt:

> An all seeing eye watching
a man working on his computer in
his room from above, Sci-fi, dark,

#### Final Image Explanation:

An all-seeing eye, completely and inconspicuously woven into the environment, looks down on a man at work. All his actions and activities are being recorded without his awareness. This all-seeing eye refers to the saying "Big Brother is watching you," a situation where you are constantly being monitored, everything about you is known, and there is no longer any privacy.
