### Project

For the inspiration of my portfolio website, I wanted to create a moodboard in Miro. My biggest source of inspiration was Instagram, where I had liked many images and videos. Manually downloading this media seemed like an impossible task.

I started working on a web scraper. Unfortunately, I ran into problems. Downloading the last items in a series didn't work, and saving videos was difficult. Images weren't a problem, but videos were a challenge.

I looked for an alternative and discovered the possibility to request an overview of my Instagram likes as a JSON file. This file contained the URLs of all the media I had liked. With the bulk downloader WFdownloader, I could then download all images and videos at once.

A new problem arose. Miro didn't support MP4 videos, but it did support GIFs. Online converters were an option, but they were often limited to processing a small number of files at a time or one by one. This would take a lot of time given the amount of my downloaded media.

I decided to develop my own video-to-GIF converter. This gave me control over the process and allowed me to convert all my videos to GIF at once. It uses the ffmpeg library.

### Code Explanation:

1. Imports:
```
import os
import subprocess
import glob
import multiprocessing
```

   - os: This module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as creating folders and working with file paths.

   - subprocess: This allows us to call external programs, such as ffmpeg, from our Python script.

   - glob: This module helps in finding all files that match a specific pattern (in this case, all .mp4 files).

   - multiprocessing: This module makes it possible to run multiple processes in parallel, allowing us to start the conversion of multiple videos simultaneously. This significantly speeds up the process, especially with a large number of files.

2. Folder Definition:

```
input_folder = r"map1"
output_folder = r"map2"

if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
    os.makedirs(output_folder)
```
-   `input_folder`: This is the folder where your MP4 files are located. You need to replace `"map1"` with the actual path to your input folder.
-   `output_folder`: This is the folder where the converted GIF files will be saved. Replace `"map2"` with the desired path to your output folder.
-   `if not os.path.exists(output_folder): os.makedirs(output_folder)`: This piece of code checks if the output folder already exists. If it doesn't, it creates the folder. This prevents errors if the folder doesn't exist.

3. The convert_to_gif function:

```
def convert_to_gif(file_path):
    # Bepaal de naam van het output bestand
    base_name = os.path.basename(file_path)
    output_file = os.path.join(output_folder, f"{os.path.splitext(base_name)[0]}.gif")

    # Volledige pad naar ffmpeg.exe
    ffmpeg_path = r"locatie/download"  # Locatie waar je de ffmpeg hebt gedownload

    # Controleer of het GIF-bestand al bestaat
    if os.path.exists(output_file):
        print(f"{output_file} bestaat al. Sla over.")
        return  # Sla de conversie over als het bestand al bestaat

    # FFmpeg command
    command = [
        ffmpeg_path, '-i', file_path,
        '-vf', 'fps=10,scale=320:-1:flags=lanczos',
        '-c:v', 'gif',
        output_file
    ]

    # Voer het commando uit
    subprocess.run(command)
    print(f"Converted {file_path} to {output_file}")
```

The function `convert_to_gif(file_path)` is responsible for converting one MP4 video file to a GIF image. Below is a step-by-step explanation:

1. Bestandsnaam bepalen:
    -   `base_name = os.path.basename(file_path)`: First, the original file name of the MP4 file is retrieved using `os.path.basename()`. The path is removed here.
    -   `output_file = os.path.join(output_folder, f"{os.path.splitext(base_name)[0]}.gif")`: Next, the path and file name for the resulting GIF file are constructed. The GIF gets the same name as the MP4 file, but with the `.gif` extension and is saved in the `output_folder`.

2. `ffmpeg` pad instellen:
    -   `ffmpeg_path = r"locatie/download"`: This defines the location of the `ffmpeg.exe` file. **Critical:** Replace `"locatie/download"` with the actual path to your `ffmpeg.exe` file on your computer.

3. Controle op bestaand bestand:
    -   `if os.path.exists(output_file): ...`: This checks if a GIF file with the same name already exists in the `output_folder`. If it does (`True`), the conversion is skipped with `return`, to prevent overwriting existing files.

4. `ffmpeg` commando opbouwen:
    -   `command = [...]`: The `ffmpeg` command is constructed step by step as a list of strings:
        -   `ffmpeg_path`: The path to the `ffmpeg` program.
        -   `-i file_path`: The `-i` option specifies the input file, in this case `file_path` (the path to the MP4 file).
        -   `-vf 'fps=10,scale=320:-1:flags=lanczos'`: The `-vf` option is used to apply a video filter. This filter consists of three parts:
            -   `fps=10`: Sets the frames per second (fps) of the GIF to 10. This can be adjusted as needed.
            -   `scale=320:-1`: Scales the video to a width of 320 pixels. The `-1` ensures that the height is proportionally adjusted.
            -   `flags=lanczos`: Specifies the `lanczos` scaling algorithm for better quality.
        -   `-c:v gif`: The `-c:v` option specifies the video codec. Here, `gif` is used to indicate that we want to make a GIF.
        -   `output_file`: The full path and file name of the resulting GIF file.

5. Commando uitvoeren en afronden:
    -   `subprocess.run(command)`: This executes the constructed `ffmpeg` command. `subprocess.run()` waits for the conversion to complete.
    -  `print(f"Converted {file_path} to {output_file}")`: Finally, a message is printed to the console to confirm that the conversion is complete, with mention of the original MP4 file and the created GIF file.

4. De main Functie:

```
def main():
    # Zoek naar MP4 bestanden in de input folder
    mp4_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(input_folder, '*.mp4'))

    # Gebruik multiprocessing om bestanden in bulk te converteren
    with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
        pool.map(convert_to_gif, mp4_files)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This function orchestrates the entire conversion process.

-   `mp4_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(input_folder, '*.mp4'))`: Finds all files in the `input_folder` that end with `.mp4` and stores the list of file paths in the variable `mp4_files`.
-   `with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:`: This creates a `Pool` of worker processes. The default number of processes is equal to the number of CPU cores on your computer. This ensures that multiple videos can be converted simultaneously.
-   `pool.map(convert_to_gif, mp4_files)`: This is the core of multiprocessing. The `map` function applies the `convert_to_gif` function to each element (MP4 file path) in the `mp4_files` list. Each file is processed by a separate process.
-   `if __name__ == '__main__': main()`: This ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly (and not when imported as a module in another script).
