As part of a group project, we developed a compact growing box designed for efficient plant growth. This growing box is equipped with sensors that monitor temperature, humidity, and growth progress. The collected data is displayed in real-time through a mobile app, allowing users to track environmental conditions and plant growth rates. This project combines technology with sustainability and offers an innovative solution for indoor gardening enthusiasts. The growing box utilizes hydroponics, a method where plants are grown without soil in a water solution containing all necessary nutrients. This technique is more efficient than traditional farming methods, as it requires less water and space.
