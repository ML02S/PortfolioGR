  ## Unwired

<hr />
For the school assignment on immersive storytelling, we had to create a game. Our game was called 'Unwired'. For Unwired, I worked with five other students on the development of a 3D game about a surgeon performing remote operations. My role in this project was designing and modeling the virtual game environment using Blender. This wasn't my only task; a significant portion of my time was dedicated to creating animations to bring the game to life. The animation process involved various tasks, from rigging models to designing and implementing movements for the robot arms and Dr. Dawson.
